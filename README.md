# NOMA-for-5G
Building a model of Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access, using a research equipment WicoMM-T, captured BPSK Modulation having interfaced on MATLAB.
This project introduces an overview of the concept, performance evaluation gains and our experimental 
trials related to NOMA like:
- Working with Superposition in NOMA
- Working with SIC in NOMA
- BER of multiple users using QPSK
- Power Allocation in NOMA
- SWIPT (Simultaneous Wireless Information and Power Transfer) - NOMA 
- MIMO (Multiple Input Multiple Output) - NOMA
